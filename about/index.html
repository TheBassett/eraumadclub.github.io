		<h5 class="">What is the MAD Club?</h5>

		<p class="">The Mobile Application Development Club (MAD Club) is Embry-Riddle's only student organization dedicated to the creation of mobile applications. This student-led organization provides students across campus the opportunity to learn and apply their skills to Software and Computer Engineering fields. Opportunities that will be available for members include workshops, student-led projects, and competitive application development.</p>
		<br>

		<h5 class="">Our mission:</h5>

		<p class="">To advocate for the development and creation of software for mobile platforms, through the education of the principles and elements of mobile application development.</p>

		<h5 class="">What is a mobile application?</h5>
		<blockquote>
			"A mobile app is a software application developed specifically for use on small, wireless computing devices, such as smartphones and tablets, rather than desktop or laptop computers."

		<p class="">The MAD Club works with more than just applications designed for a single smartphone. Mobile applications development encompasses devices across the board - including smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, virtual reality (VR) apparatuses, and others. </p>
		<br>
		<p>In mobile app development, the MAD Club targets four major areas:</p>

			<h5 class="center">Design</h5>

			<p class="">A well developed mobile application is one that excels both in function and in form. Club members will learn more about the proper design language for an app while creating beautiful and flexible user interfaces.</p>

			<h5 class="center">Functionality</h5>

			<p class="">Members will design and build mobile applications that have a defined purpose and function and always have some value to the user. Functions can go far beyond the software itself, and the application can integrate with other software and hardware. </p>

			<h5 class="center">Programming</h5>

			<p class="">At the core of any mobile application is the code that defines the software. This is the traditional aspect of mobile application development. Members will collaborate to build applications for various platforms in various languages, such as C, Java, HTML, Javascript, and more.</p>

			<h5 class="center">Distribution</h5>

			<p class="">Preparing an application for distribution is often overlooked in most workshops and development sessions. Members will build applications and software that are scalable and can be implemented on hundreds of different devices.</p>
